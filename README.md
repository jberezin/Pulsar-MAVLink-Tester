# Pulsar MAVLink Tester

My goal here is twofold;  
First - I'd like to pull together all I have learnt and achieved when talking MAVLink between an Arduino board and ArduPilot running on my Flight Controller (Cube Orange).
Second - I'd like to share it in the hope that someone else can benefit from it, just like I have from everyone else out there doing this stuff before me.  In particular, the those that started (Juan Pedro LÃ³pez & Pedro Albuquerque....thank you, thank you, thank you) and answered questions in the following two threads in the ArduPilot forum.  I would highly encourage anyone interested in this space to read both of those threads from start to finish, you will learn a lot along the way.
